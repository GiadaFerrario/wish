## Wish sales analysis

This is an academic project developed during the Bachelor in Computer Science course, its aim is to **choose a dataset** and ðŸ“Š **analyse it**.

The dataset taken for analysis refers to the **summer sales of the Wish e-commerce platform**. The reasons for choosing this set are curiosity about the topic, so understanding in which direction sales are moving, and the number of columns present (43) that allowed us to do a good analysis. 
In the dataset each row present represents a product sold with the various related characteristics such as unit price and quantity sold. The columns that were taken into consideration in carrying out this analysis are mainly: **category, color, units sold, unit price, and ratings received**.

The site from which the dataset was taken is https://www.kaggle.com/jmmvutu/summer-products-and-sales-in-ecommerce-wish where there is, in addition, more information about it.

The libraries that we used are: Pandas, Numpy and Plotly.

The analysis that we have done are:
* 10 most used tags and units sold per tag
* 10 best-selling colors
* Percentage of colored products sold per tag
* Price distribution
* Distribution of ratings and units sold by price range
* Distribution of ratings and units sold by price range limited to a specific product (shorts)
